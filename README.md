Hello! This is a simple chatting app I created back in 2016 to get the hang of Firebase Authentication and the Realtime Database. Unfortunately, I'm no longer able to maintain the code, so I'm putting this out here in hopes that it might be helpful to someone looking to learn more about Firebase or integrating backends into a mobile app in general. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
